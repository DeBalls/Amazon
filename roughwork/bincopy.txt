Removing anything that looks like a company name from text data can be a challenging task because there is no strict definition of what constitutes a company name. One approach you could try is to use a named entity recognition (NER) tool to identify and remove named entities that are labeled as organizations.

Here is an example of how you could do this using the `spaCy` library:

```python
import pandas as pd
import spacy

# Load the data from the CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Load a spaCy model for named entity recognition
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Define a function to remove company names from a text
def remove_company_names(text):
    # Process the text with spaCy to extract named entities
    doc = nlp(text)
    # Iterate over the named entities and remove those labeled as organizations
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == 'ORG':
            text = text.replace(ent.text, '')
    return text

# Apply the function to the column
data['COLUMN_NAME'] = data['COLUMN_NAME'].apply(remove_company_names)

# Save the modified data to a new CSV file
data.to_csv('modified_data.csv', index=False)
```

This code is similar to the previous example but uses `spaCy` to process the text and extract named entities. It defines a function `remove_company_names` that takes a text as input, processes it with `spaCy` to extract named entities, and removes those entities that are labeled as organizations (`ent.label_ == 'ORG'`).

Next, it applies this function to the specified column using the `apply` method of the `pandas.Series` object. Finally, it saves the modified data to a new CSV file using `pandas.to_csv`.

You will need to modify this code to specify the correct column name and install and load a `spaCy` model for named entity recognition. Note that this approach is not perfect and may not remove all company names or may remove other text that is not a company name. You can experiment with different NER tools and techniques to improve the results. ðŸ˜Š
